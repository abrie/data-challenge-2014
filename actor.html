            <p>A Bundled Edge View of the Github Event Graph</p>
            <p><small>Events occur in patterns, as indicated here by coloured groups. Any event can lead to another. Sequential events are connected by lines. Some events are more likely to follow others. Higher probabilty is indicated by heavier, more opaque lines. This particular view is built from the perspective of an Actor. <a href="index.html">Here</a> is a Repositories point of view.</small></p>
