            <p>A Bundled Edge View of the Github Event Graph</p>
            <p><small>Events occur in patterns, as indicated here by coloured groups. This view contains Gist events. Gist Events are no longer produced, but their history remains. They are only visible from an Actor perspective because they are not associated with a repository. Nonetheless, a Gist event may be followed by a repository event. Although clearly they are more likely to accompany other Gist events. <a href="python.html">Here</a> is a <b>Python</b> Repository's point of view.</small></p>
            <p><small>The graph can be zoomed and panned. The bundling parameter can be adjusted with this slider:</small></p>
