            <p>A Bundled Edge View of the Github Event Graph</p>
            <p><small>A Stochastic Matrix is a mathematical construct describing the probabilities of event transitions. Events occur in patterns as indicated here by coloured groups. The groups were detected by using a markov clustering algorithm. Sequential events are connected by lines. Any event can lead to another, but some events are more likely to follow others. Higher probabilities are indicated by heavier, more opaque lines. This view was built by analysis of all the repositories. It represents the transitions from a repository's point of view.</p><p><a href="actor.html">Here</a> is the same process applied to an Actor.</small></p>
            <p><small>The graph can be zoomed and panned. The bundling parameter can be adjusted with this slider:</small></p>
