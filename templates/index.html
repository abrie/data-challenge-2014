<p>A Bundled Edge View of the Github Event Graph</p>
<p><small>This plot represents a stochastic matrix constructed from the analysis of github events. A stochastic matrix is a construct which describes the probability of an event. Events occur in patterns dependent on the previous state. Sometimes events cluster together, as indicated here by coloured groups. The groups were detected by using a markov clustering algorithm<sup><a href="micans.org/mcl/">1</a></sup>. Sequential events are connected by lines. Any event can lead to another, but some events are more likely to follow others. Higher probabilities are indicated by heavier, more opaque lines. The probabilities of events depends on the perspective of the observer. In this case an aggregate of all Github repositories. </p><p><a href="actor.html">Here</a> is the same process applied as an aggregate of Actor perspectives.</small></p>
<p><small>The graph can be zoomed and panned. The bundling parameter can be adjusted with this slider:</small></p>
