<h3>Bundled-Edge Views of the Github Event Graph</h3>

<p>This plot represents a stochastic matrix constructed from the analysis of github events. A stochastic matrix describes the probability of future events given the current state. Events occur in patterns and sometimes cluster together. Cluster membership is indicated by colour. Clusters are assigned by a flow-based markov clustering algorithm<sup><a href="micans.org/mcl/">1</a></sup>. Sequential events are connected by lines. Nodes in a cluster are sorted by the sum of their indegree and outdegree weights, then arranged in a clockwise-descending direction. Any event can lead to another but some events are more likely to follow others. Higher probabilities are indicated by heavier, more opaque lines.</p>
