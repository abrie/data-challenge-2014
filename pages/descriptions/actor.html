<h3>Bundled-Edge Views of the Github Event Graph</h3>

<p>Edges are colored according to the cluster of the originating event. This disguises the direction of intra-cluster event transitions. This plot illustrates the event graph from an aggregate <em>actor</em> perspective. Note the presence of GistEvents which are invisible from a <em>repository</em> perspective. Github no longer produces GistEvents<sup><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#gistevent">3</a></sup>&ndash; but their edges remain.</p>
