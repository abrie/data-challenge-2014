<p>A Bundled Edge View of the Github Event Graph</p>
<p><small>The node labled <i>start</i> leads to events which were not preceeded by anything. Thus it may be regarded as pointing to the first events: such as creating a repository or pushing code.  Any particular moment contains a distribution of events. The distribution is indicated by the length of the label line. The length is a linear scale. A longer line indicates an accumulation of the event without any subsequent event. Note the relative paucity of stale PullRequests and Issues.</p><p><a href="ruby.html">Here</a> is a view of Ruby centric repositories.</small></p>
